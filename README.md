Materials go through Practical Crypto Spring 2025.

# Assignment_1
Python implementation to break Caesar cipher. Implement letter frequency analysis to recover plaintext to break Vigenere cipher.

# Assignment_2
Give a device target that uses statical CBC encryption. Implement a padding oracle attack. Then, padding path to estimate the correct cookie length and break the plaintext of cookie.

# Assignment_3 
Solving discrete log problem. Implement a brute-force attack over a small sample. Implement Baby-step Giant-step and Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to solve a system of congruences. Implement Pohlig-Hellman algorithm to compute discrete log problem of target. Finally use the written Pohlig-Hellman algorithm to perform a high-level elgamal attack.
